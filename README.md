# My CS Self-Study Curriculum

This repo contains demonstrations of what I've learned in through my CS self-study curriculum.

I've based this curriculum on the course provided on the [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com) website, which was developed by Oz Nova and Myles Byrne.

In the repo, there is a directory for each major subject (e.g. Programming, Math for CS), and within each directory are sub-directories that contain demo code and notes for modules of a course in that subject. The subjects and the respective courses are:

1. Programming - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (M.I.T. Open Courseware Library)
