# My CS Self-Study Curriculum

This repo contains demonstrations of what I've learned in the course of my CS self-study curriculum.

I've based this curriculum on the course provided on the teachyourselfcs.com website.

There is a directory for each major subject (e.g. Programming, Math for CS), and within each directory are sub-directories that contain demo code and notes for a course in that subject. The subjects and their respective courses I've started so far are:

1. Programming - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - M.I.T. Open Courseware Library
